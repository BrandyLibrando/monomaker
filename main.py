#  Description:                                #
#  Running this script converts an image into  #
#  a monochrome image represented as a byte    #
#  array, which is mainly used for displays,   #
#  such as the SSD1306.                        #
#                                              #

from PIL import Image
import numpy as nmp
import os

# Notes:
# - Image file to be converted MUST be located in the same directory as the script.
# - A directory (folder) "out" is created to store the output. Having a folder with the same name would
#   cause the script to use that folder instead.
# - Not all image file types are guaranteed to work, and is programmed so far mainly for
#   PNG, BMP, and JPG/JPEG image files (transparency supported). Other file types may still work
#   since the channels are checked, not the image format (except for PNG).
# - Palettized images will not work. Convert the image to RGB space beforehand.
# - Using animated/multiframe image types will not work.


### Get filename
